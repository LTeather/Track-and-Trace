# Track & Trace
Final year university project. A Responsive and Live COVID Track &amp; Trace Application.

I will not be supporting those who choose to fork/use it for their own personal use, again this only serves to be a portfolio piece in its current state. Any issues created will likely be ignored.

## What does this project do exactly?
The projectâ€™s aim is to be a live track and trace application in which users can see map data, and check if they have been in recent contact or not. 
There is also a backend system for business and medical teams to input user data for processing and deciding if the risk factor warrants a notification to the user. 

## Required 
You will need:
 - XAMPP (for running the database)
 - Visual Studio Code
 - Node.js v13 (current build)

## Running Locally
Upload the database and run Apache & MySQL on XAMPP. Then hit F5 in Visual Studio Code.

You will need to run: "npm i"
In the terminal for it to grab all of the modules required on first starting the project.
